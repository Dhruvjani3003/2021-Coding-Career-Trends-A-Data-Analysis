# 🧠 AI Survey Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the AI Survey Data Analysis project! This project explores and models real-world survey data from new coders using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project was originally completed in 2023 and revisited in 2025 to prepare it for open-source sharing. It walks through:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning & transformation
- 🧠 Machine Learning:
  - KMeans Clustering
  - Decision Tree Classification
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Regression

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: 2021 New Coder Survey (Kaggle)
- **Note**: The dataset is not included in this repo due to licensing. You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/freecodecamp/2021-new-coder-survey) and place it in your project folder.

## 🚀 Features & Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Dropped duplicates and handled missing data
- Cleaned and renamed survey columns

### 2. EDA & Visualization
- Bar plots, histograms, boxplots, scatter matrices
- Insights on income vs age, learning hours, etc.

### 3. Feature Transformation
- Power transformation and normalization
- Outlier removal using Z-score method

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- **KMeans Clustering**: Groups based on job security and age
- **Decision Tree**: Classifies high vs low income
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicts job loss likelihood
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Predicts actual income
